# Signature
I'm one of the people who love to include their name in everything. I know its kinda annoying for everyone else but its fun too! So, I have created this GUI based program which can include your name, date and time in any python script or txt or any file you want!
### Usage and about the program
Its pretty easy to use, the GUI is made for users who have less idea regarding python and want to use it directly. I've created an exe from pyinstaller. So, if you want to only use it, just download the exe and use without any issues!

## Updates
Now I've created an eye catching GUI design for the program, and has added one specific function, instead of you writing the date and time manually, the program will fetch that from its metadata and will include by itself. You'll have to write your SIGN for once and then it'll create a file which it will access later on to create signature for all files.

You'll be greeted with this screen.
Steps to Add yourself:
1. First Of all enter something like - Made by #Your name - The pro coder (add this in the first box)
2. After this if you want you can add date and time yoursef like Date: 12/03/2021 and Time: 23:45 
3. Or you can simply click the button Date and Time, which will add the current time automatically in it
4. Last thing - go to browse file and select your python file

Here are some photos of me doing this:

As good it seems, this program does have a draw back. You'll have to specify again and again regarding your name and click on that date and time button again and again. In my case I have to only browse the file and it'll add my name, reason - I have added a special feature in it, if you are not clicking, entering or doing anything on he GUI then it gets time automatically and adds it to the file. This same feature can be beneficial to you. For this to access just go to line 30, change the name and voila! 

I hope you like it! A star would be appreciated. Thankyou.
